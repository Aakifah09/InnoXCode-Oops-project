Here’s a clean and professional README.md you can use for your GitHub project:

🔐 Encryption & Decryption System (Java OOP)
📌 Overview

This project is a Java-based Encryption and Decryption System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

It implements three widely used symmetric encryption algorithms:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

DES (Data Encryption Standard)

Triple DES (3DES)

The application allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text using these algorithms.


🚀 Features

🔑 AES encryption & decryption

🔐 DES encryption & decryption

🛡 Triple DES (3DES) encryption & decryption

Clean OOP-based design

Modular and extensible structure

Simple console-based interface


🏗 Project Structure (OOP Design)

The project follows core OOP principles:

Encapsulation – Each encryption algorithm is implemented in its own class.

Abstraction – Common encryption methods are defined through interfaces or abstract classes.

Polymorphism – Different algorithms can be used interchangeably through a common interface.

Modularity – Code is organized into separate packages and classes for maintainability.


🛠 Technologies Used

Java

Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)


▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code).

Compile and run Main.java.


📖 How It Works

User selects the encryption algorithm (AES, DES, or 3DES).

User enters:

Plaintext (for encryption)

Ciphertext (for decryption)

Secret key

The system processes the input and displays the result.


🔒 Security Note

AES is recommended for modern secure applications.

DES is considered outdated and insecure for sensitive data.

Triple DES provides stronger security than DES but is slower than AES.


📚 Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

Practical implementation of cryptographic algorithms

Application of OOP principles in Java

Understanding of symmetric encryption techniques

Secure key handling basics


📌 Future Improvements

Add GUI (JavaFX or Swing)

Add file encryption support

Add hashing algorithms (SHA-256)

Improve key management system
